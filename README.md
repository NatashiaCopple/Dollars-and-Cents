# Dollars-and-Cents
P4.7   The following pseudocode describes how to extract the dollars and cents from a price given as a floating-point value. For example, a price 2.95 yields values 2 and 95 for the dollars and cents. Assign the price to an integer variable dollars. Multiply the difference price - dollars by 100 and add 0.5. Assign the result to an integer variable cents. Translate this pseudocode into a Java program. Read a price and print the dollars and cents. Test your program with inputs 2.95 and 4.35.
